# Amazon Clone (Non-Responsive)

This is a simple **Amazon clone** I built a year ago while learning web development. The project focuses on structuring an e-commerce layout using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, but it is **not responsive** for different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure of the web pages  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Basic interactivity  

## 📌 Features  
- 🛒 Basic e-commerce UI design  
- 🔍 Navigation bar and search functionality  
- 📦 Product listings and categories  
- 🎨 Static design (not responsive)  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Make the website **fully responsive**  
- Improve **UI/UX design**  
- Add **backend functionality** for dynamic content  

Feel free to check out the project and contribute! 🎉
