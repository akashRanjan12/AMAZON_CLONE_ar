Amazon Clone (Non-Responsive)
This is a simple Amazon clone I built a year ago while learning web development. The project focuses on structuring an e-commerce layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but does not include responsiveness for different screen sizes.

Features
Basic e-commerce UI design
Product listings and categories
Navigation bar and search functionality
Static design without responsiveness
Technologies Used
HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for basic interactions
Future Improvements
Make the website fully responsive
Improve UI/UX design
Add backend functionality
Feel free to check out the project and contribute! ðŸš€
